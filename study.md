## Deliverables

After reading the `game-project` prompt and the `game-project-api` documentation
please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss during our next
class.

Submit detailed answers to the following in this file via a pull request:

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.

-   The data structure you plan to use.
I plan to use an array for the game play.

-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
For the gameboard I would use divs with a class for each tile. I would organize
the tiles in JS using a coordinate system, [horizontal position, vertical position]
for example, [1, 3] would be the bottom left tile.

-   How you plan to approach this project.
figuring out how to work with the back end API.
planning the game play logic, layout, and flow of user activities.
Build the UI, and game logic.
Get it working with back end.

-   4-8 user stories for your game project.
As a user:
-I want to log in.
-I want to select wether to play as X or O.
-I want to start a game.
-I want to log out.

As a returning user:
-I want to see my game history upon log in.
-I want to see my game history at the end of each game.
-Change my password.


-   How you plan to keep your code modular.
Having separate files and keeping them organized in a simple and thorough set of
directories, using good naming conventions for files and directories.

-   What creative spin will you add to your project?
I would like to make it a very clean and easy UI. Having
some effects when game moves are made to make game play more satisfying.
Making sign-in optional.

-   How will you use version control to backup / track your project?
I would like to make commits as often as possible. Realistically I'll shoot
for making a commit for about every function or 2-3 times per file.

-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses?
I may have my hands full with core project elements but I would like to keep win
and loss scores.

You may want to submit pictures for your wireframes and/or user stories.
